# Michigan Hackers Android App
This project is the Android application for the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor student organization called Michigan Hackers.
The goal of this project is to make a user-friendly application that will provide information about and tools for Michigan Hackers.
This project is also used to help the members of the Michigan Hackers Android App Team learn the skills related to Android application development.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

### Java SDK
Install the latest version of the Java Software Development Kit (SDK).  
Java is the programming language our team uses to develop the app.  
[Download](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)

### Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
Install an IDE to use to work on the project. Android Studio is recommended.  
An IDE makes programming the application faster and easier.  
[Download](https://developer.android.com/studio/)

### Git
Install git, the software our team uses for version control.  
[Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

#### Github Account
Create a Github account to interact with the remote repository.  
[Join](https://github.com/join)

## Installing
1. Open Android Studio
2. Select "Check out project from Version Control"
3. Select "Github"
4. Paste the link to this Github repository (https://github.com/michiganhackers/androidapp) and select "Clone"
5. Get the google-services.json file from an Android team leader and place it in the androidapp/app directory.  
6. Get the MichiganHackers.jks file from an Android team leader and place it in the androidapp/app directory.  

# Deployment
The app currently has a bug that makes it so that you can't see the calendar events in the debug version. The current work-around is to install the app from the playstore and sign in with your Google account. This allows you to see the calendar events in the debug version if you sign in with the same google account.

# Contributing
You will be working in master branch by default after cloning the repository. To contribute, you will need to do the following:  
1. Checkout the develop branch
2. Create a new branch from the develop branch. This is the branch you will be working in.
3. Whenever you finish the feature you are working on, merge it back into the develop branch.
